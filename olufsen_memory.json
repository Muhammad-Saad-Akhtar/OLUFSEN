Good luck!\n\nAs for reducing the brightness to 0, I apologize but that is not possible as brightness is a measure of the amount of light present in a given area, and it cannot be reduced to negative levels. Brightness is always measured in terms of how much light is present, never how little. So, there is no need to worry about reducing the brightness to 0 as it is not possible."
